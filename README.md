# BEAD
**Background Enrichment for Anomaly Detection**
|| *{Background Enrichis pour (la Détection d'Anomalies) Anomalie Détection}*



BEAD is a Python package that uses deep learning based methods for anomaly detection in HEP data for new physics searches. BEAD has been designed with modularity in mind, to enable usage of various unsupervised latent variable models for any task.

BEAD has five main running modes:

- Data handling: Deals with handling file types, conversions between them and pre-processing the data to feed as inputs to the DL models.

- Training: Train your model to learn implicit representations of your background data that may come from multiple sources/generators to get a single, encriched latent representation of it.

- Inference: Using a model trained on an enriched background, feed in samples you want to detect anomalies in and watch the magic happen.

- Plotting: After running Inference, or Training you can generate plots similar towhat is shown in the paper. These include performance plots as well as different visualizations of the learned data.

- Diagnostics: Enabling this mode allows running profilers that measure a host of metrics connected to the usage of the compute node you run on to help you optimize the code if needed(using CPU-GPU metrics).

For more information, follow the install instructions below go to the directory `./BEAD/bead/` and then run the command ```poetry run bead -h``` to get detailed instructions on running the package and the available customizations.

For a full chain example, look at the [full chain example](#example) below!



# Installation
1. Poetry: BEAD is managed by the poetry package manager - this simplifies the task of creating an environment, installing the right dependencies, version incompatibilities etc. So first start with installing poetry according to the instructions given [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

2. After installing poetry, clone this repository to your working directory.

3. Enter the `BEAD/bead/` directory using `cd bead`

4. Install the BEAD package using:

        poetry install

5. You are now ready to start running the package! As a first step try the following command:

        poetry run bead -h

    This should bring up the help window that explains all the various running modes of bead.

6. Start with creating a new workspace and project like so:

        poetry run bead -m new_project -p <WORKSPACE_NAME> <PROJECT_NAME>

    This will setup all the required directories inside `BEAD/bead/workspaces/`. 

    For any of the operation modes below, if you would like to see verbose outputs to know exactly what is going on, use the `-v` flag at the end of     the command like so:

        poetry run bead -m new_project -p <WORKSPACE_NAME> <PROJECT_NAME> -v

    **Remember** to use a different workspace everytime you want to modify your input data, since all the projects inside a given workspace share and overwrite the input data. 

    If you want to use the same input data but change something else in the pipeline (for eg. different config options such as `model_name`, `loss_function` etc.), use the same `workspace_name`, but create a new project with a different `'project_name'`. On doing this, your data will already be ready from the previous project in that workspace so you can skip directly to the subsequent steps.

6. After creating a new workspace, it is essential to move the `*_input_data.csv` files to the `BEAD/bead/workspaces/WORKSPACE_NAME/data/csv/` directory

7. After making sure the input files are in the right location, you can start converting the `csv` files to the file type specified in the `BEAD/bead/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/config/<PROJECT_NAME>_config.py` file. `h5` is the default and preferred method. To run the conversion mode, use:

        poetry run bead -m convert_csv -p WORKSPACE_NAME PROJECT_NAME

    This should parse the csv, split the information into event-level, jet-level and constituent-level data.

8. Then you can start data pre-processing based on the flags in the config file, using the command:

        poetry run bead -m prepare_inputs -p WORKSPACE_NAME PROJECT_NAME

    This will create the preprocessed tensors and save them as `.pt` files for events, jets and constituents separately.

9. Once the tensors are prepared, you are now ready to train the model chosen in the configs along with all the specified training parameters, using:

        poetry run bead -m train -p WORKSPACE_NAME PROJECT_NAME

    This should store a trained pytorch model as a `.pt` file in the `.../PROJECT_NAME/output/models/` directory as well as train loss metrics in the `.../PROJECT_NAME/output/results/` directory.

10. After a trained model has been saved, you are now ready to run inference like so:

        poetry run bead -m detect -p WORKSPACE_NAME PROJECT_NAME

    This will save all model outputs in the `.../PROJECT_NAME/output/results/` directory.

11. The plotting mode is called on the outputs from the previous step like so:

        poetry run bead -m plot -p WORKSPACE_NAME PROJECT_NAME

    This will produce all plots.

    If you would like to only produce plots for training losses, use the `-o` flag like so:

        poetry run bead -m plot -p WORKSPACE_NAME PROJECT_NAME -o train_metrics

    If you only want plots from the inference, use:

        poetry run bead -m plot -p WORKSPACE_NAME PROJECT_NAME -o test_metrics

12. Chaining modes to avoid repetitive running of commands is facilitated by the `-m chain` mode, which **requires** the `-o` flag to determine which modes need to be chained and in what order. Look at the example below.

# Example

Say I created a new workspace that tests `SVJ` samples with `rinv=0.3` and a new project that runs the `ConvVAE` model for `500 epochs` with a learning rate of `1e-4` like so:

        poetry run bead -m new_project -p svj_rinv3 convVae_ep500_lr4

Then I moved the input `CSVs` to the `BEAD/bead/workspaces/svj_rinv3/data/csv/` directory. Then I want to run all the modes until the inference step, I just need to run the command:

        poetry run bead -m chain -p svj_rinv3 convVae_ep500_lr4 -o convertcsv_prepareinputs_train_detect

and I'm good to log off for a snooze!

*Happy hunting!*
